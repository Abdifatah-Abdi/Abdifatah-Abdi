# Hello!
My name is Abdifatah, Abdi, but you can call me Abdi.\
I'm a self-taught developer that's from Canada I'm always wanting to learn more.\
Typically, I'd spend like 5 hours a day programming. You may say that's not good and I agree with you 100%.

I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C#, Lua, and a bit of Python, C, and C++.\
And uhh, yeah...\
thanks?
